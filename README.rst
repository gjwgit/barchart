Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This `MLHub`_ package provides a simple demonstration "model" showing
the concept of bar charts. This is useful for the new data scientist
learning the power of visualising data. Barcharts are one simple yet
effective approach to understanding the narrative the data can tell
us.

The examples come from the `Essentials of Data Science`_ by Graham
Williams. Further support material is also available from `Togaware`_.
