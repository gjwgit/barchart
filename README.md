Visualise Data Through Barcharts
================================

This [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai) package provides a simple demonstration
"model" showing the concept of bar charts. This is useful for the new
data scientist learning the power of visualising data. Barcharts are one
simple yet effective approach to understanding the narrative the data
can tell us.

The examples come from the [Essentials of Data
Science](https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science) by Graham Williams.
Further support material is also available from
[Togaware](https://essentials.togaware.com).
