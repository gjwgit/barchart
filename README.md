# Visualise Data Through Barcharts

Barcharts are a simple yet effective approach to understanding the
narrative the data can tell us.  This [MLHub](https://mlhub.ai)
package provides a simple demonstration illustrating the concept of
bar charts. This is useful for the new data scientist learning the
power of visualising data.

The examples here come from the [Essentials of Data
Science](https://bit.ly/essentials_data_science) by Graham Williams.
Further support material is also available from
[Togaware](https://essentials.togaware.com).
